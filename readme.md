In this project, we learn the structural causal model in a federated setup utilizing the modularity of modular-DCM.


Data generation:
High-dimensional confounder.


Run command:
Step 1: Run data_generation.ipynb


Need future fix for Fed_TGAN:
1. Differentiate between continuous vs discrete in terms of conditional vs joint distribution.
   2. _transform_continuous
